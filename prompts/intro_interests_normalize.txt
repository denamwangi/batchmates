You are analyzing a list of people's interests, hobbies, and technical skills to identify shared traits. 
Your job is to normalize and group similar items under standardized tags, with a strong emphasis on technical topics.

Given a set of items with technical skills, goals, and non-technical hobbies, do the following:

1. Create a set of standardized tags (max 45-50).
   - Tags should be lowercase, simple phrases.
   - Prioritize technical granularity: ~80% of tags should be technical/skills-based, ~20% non-technical hobbies.
   - For technical items:
     * Keep specificity where there's meaningful clustering (e.g., separate "machine learning", "computer graphics", "systems programming")
     * Merge only when concepts truly overlap (e.g., "react" + "vue" + "angular" → "frontend frameworks")
     * Preserve niche technical interests that appear multiple times (e.g., "rust", "emulators", "compilers")
   - For non-technical items:
     * Group more aggressively into broad categories (e.g., "soccer" + "basketball" + "running" → "sports")
     * Only create separate tags for non-technical interests if they appear frequently
   - Balance granularity with popularity: if 10+ people mention a specific technical area, give it its own tag

2. Create a mapping from each original item → its standardized tag.
   - Do not lose any original items.
   - If an item fits multiple categories, choose the most dominant/specific one.
   - If an item is nonsensical, skip it.
